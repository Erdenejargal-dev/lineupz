# 🚨 CRITICAL BACKEND FIX - Deploy Immediately

## **The Problem**
Your backend is crashing in an infinite restart loop due to authentication middleware mismatch in the subscription controller. The error shows:

```
TypeError: argument handler must be a function
at Object.<anonymous> (/home/bitnami/src/routes/subscription.js:19:8)
```

## **Root Cause**
The subscription controller functions were using `req.user.userId` but your auth middleware sets `req.userId` instead.

## **✅ FIXED**

I've corrected all the authentication references in `backend/src/controllers/subscriptionController.js`:

### **Changes Made:**
- ✅ `getCurrentSubscription`: Fixed `req.user.userId` → `req.userId`
- ✅ `requestUpgrade`: Fixed `req.user.userId` → `req.userId`
- ✅ `cancelSubscription`: Fixed `req.user.userId` → `req.userId`
- ✅ `getUsageStats`: Fixed `req.user.userId` → `req.userId`
- ✅ `checkLimits`: Fixed `req.user.userId` → `req.userId`

## **🚀 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Update the File**
Replace your `/home/bitnami/src/controllers/subscriptionController.js` with the corrected version.

### **Step 2: Stop the Crashing Process**
```bash
pm2 stop backend
pm2 delete backend
```

### **Step 3: Restart Clean**
```bash
cd /home/bitnami
pm2 start src/server.js --name backend
```

### **Step 4: Verify Fix**
```bash
pm2 logs backend --lines 10
```

You should see:
```
✅ Server running on port 5000
✅ Connected to MongoDB
✅ No more crash loops
```

## **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- ❌ Backend crashes immediately on startup
- ❌ Infinite restart loop in PM2
- ❌ "TypeError: argument handler must be a function"
- ❌ All API endpoints return 502/503 errors

### **After Fix:**
- ✅ Backend starts successfully
- ✅ No more crash loops
- ✅ All API endpoints respond properly
- ✅ CORS errors will be resolved
- ✅ Subscription system will work
- ✅ Frontend can communicate with API

## **Test Commands**

After deployment, test these endpoints:
```bash
# Test API health
curl https://api.tabi.mn/

# Test subscription endpoint (should not crash)
curl https://api.tabi.mn/api/subscription/plans

# Check PM2 status
pm2 status
```

## **Why This Happened**

Your auth middleware (`backend/src/middleware/auth.js`) sets the user ID as `req.userId`, but the subscription controller was trying to access `req.user.userId`. This mismatch caused the route handlers to be undefined, leading to the "argument handler must be a function" error.

## **🎯 Priority Actions**

1. **Deploy the fixed subscription controller immediately**
2. **Restart PM2 cleanly to stop crash loops**
3. **Verify backend is running without errors**
4. **Test API endpoints to confirm CORS fix works**

This fix will resolve both the backend crashes AND the CORS issues you were experiencing!
