# 🔄 FRONTEND RESTART REQUIRED

## **Issue Identified**
The frontend is still calling the wrong API URL (`https://tabi.mn/api/...` instead of `https://api.tabi.mn/api/...`). This is because the environment variable change hasn't taken effect yet.

## **🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX - Restart Frontend**

### **Step 1: Stop Your Frontend Development Server**
In your terminal where Next.js is running, press:
```
Ctrl + C
```

### **Step 2: Restart the Frontend**
```bash
cd C:\Users\HiTech\Desktop\lineupz
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### **Step 3: Verify Environment Variable**
After restart, check the browser console. The API calls should now go to:
- ✅ `https://api.tabi.mn/api/subscription/current` (correct)
- ❌ `https://tabi.mn/api/subscription/current` (old, wrong)

## **Why This Happens**
- Environment variables are loaded when the development server starts
- Changing `.env.local` requires a restart to take effect
- The old cached value was still being used

## **Expected Result After Restart**
- ✅ API calls go to correct URL (`api.tabi.mn`)
- ✅ Subscription data loads properly
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Frontend-backend communication works

## **Alternative: Production Deployment**
If you're testing on production (https://tabi.mn), you need to:

1. **Deploy the frontend** with the updated environment variable
2. **Or update the production environment variable** in your hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)

## **Quick Test**
After restarting, open browser console and verify:
- No more `GET https://tabi.mn/api/subscription/current 404` errors
- API calls should show `GET https://api.tabi.mn/api/subscription/current 200`

**Restart your frontend development server now to fix the API URL issue! 🚀**
