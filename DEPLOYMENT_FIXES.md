# Deployment Fixes Applied

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve deployment issues and improve the Tabi (lineupz) project.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API URL Consistency ✅
**Problem**: Mixed usage of hardcoded localhost URLs and environment variables across components.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/components/JoinLineForm.jsx` - Changed hardcoded `http://localhost:5000/api` to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL + '/api'`
- `src/components/DashboardRouter.jsx` - Changed hardcoded `http://localhost:5000/api` to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL + '/api'`
- `src/app/creator-dashboard/page.jsx` - Already using environment variable correctly

**Result**: All components now consistently use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.

### 2. Schedule Section Visibility ✅
**Problem**: Schedule configuration section was hidden by default in creator dashboard.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/app/creator-dashboard/page.jsx` - Changed `showSchedule` initial state from `false` to `true`

**Result**: Schedule section is now visible by default when creating new lines.

### 3. Duplicate Code Removal ✅
**Problem**: Duplicate "Code Type" field in creator dashboard form.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/app/creator-dashboard/page.jsx` - Removed duplicate code type selection field

**Result**: Clean form without duplicate fields.

### 4. Client-Side Hydration Safety ✅
**Problem**: localStorage access during server-side rendering could cause hydration mismatches.

**Files Fixed**:
- `src/components/DashboardRouter.jsx` - Added proper client-side checks and state management
- `src/app/creator-dashboard/page.jsx` - Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` check before localStorage access

**Result**: Prevents hydration mismatches and SSR issues.

### 5. Error Boundary Implementation ✅
**Problem**: No error handling for unexpected runtime errors during deployment.

**Files Created**:
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` - New error boundary component with user-friendly error display

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Wrapped application with ErrorBoundary component

**Result**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly error messages and recovery options.

## Environment Configuration

### Current Setup
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://13.229.113.229:5000
```

### For Production Deployment
Ensure the following environment variables are set in your deployment platform (Vercel):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-domain.com
```

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:
- [ ] Verify all API URLs use environment variables
- [ ] Test schedule section visibility in creator dashboard
- [ ] Ensure no duplicate form fields
- [ ] Test localStorage access on different devices
- [ ] Verify error boundary catches and displays errors properly

### Vercel Deployment:
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Ensure backend API is accessible from the frontend domain
- [ ] Test CORS configuration allows requests from your Vercel domain
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints are working correctly

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent API Configuration**: All components now use environment variables for API URLs
2. **Better UX**: Schedule section is immediately visible for line creators
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed duplicate form fields and improved code organization
4. **Deployment Safety**: Added hydration safety and error boundaries
5. **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and environment configuration

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Local Testing**: Test with both localhost and production API URLs
2. **Mobile Testing**: Verify localStorage access works on mobile devices
3. **Error Testing**: Intentionally cause errors to test error boundary
4. **Schedule Testing**: Create lines and verify schedule section works properly
5. **API Testing**: Test all API endpoints with the new URL configuration

## Notes

- The project structure supports both queue management and appointment booking
- All major deployment issues have been addressed
- The application should now deploy successfully to Vercel without crashes
- Error boundary will catch any remaining issues and provide user-friendly feedback
