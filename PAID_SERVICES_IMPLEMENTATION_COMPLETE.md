# ðŸš€ PAID SERVICES IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE GUIDE

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete **Paid Services** system for Tabi that allows businesses to charge customers for joining queues or booking appointments. This system integrates seamlessly with your existing BYL payment infrastructure.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### ðŸ”§ Backend Changes

#### 1. **Line Model Updates** (`backend/src/models/Line.js`)
Added comprehensive pricing schema:

```javascript
pricing: {
  isPaid: Boolean,           // Whether service requires payment
  price: Number,             // Price amount (1-1,000,000)
  currency: String,          // MNT, USD, EUR
  paymentMethods: [String],  // byl, cash, card, bank_transfer
  description: String,       // Optional price description
  priceType: String         // per_service, per_appointment, per_hour
}
```

**Features:**
- âœ… **Flexible pricing types**: Per service, per appointment, or hourly rates
- âœ… **Multi-currency support**: MNT (â‚®), USD ($), EUR (â‚¬)
- âœ… **Multiple payment methods**: BYL digital, cash, card, bank transfer
- âœ… **Price validation**: Ensures valid pricing for paid services
- âœ… **Optional descriptions**: Explain what's included in the price

#### 2. **Form Validation**
- âœ… Price must be > 0 for paid services
- âœ… At least one payment method required
- âœ… Price description character limit (200)
- âœ… Currency validation

### ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Changes

#### 1. **CreateLineForm Updates** (`src/components/CreateLineForm.jsx`)
Added beautiful pricing section with:

**Visual Design:**
- âœ… **Green-themed pricing section** with money emoji (ðŸ’°)
- âœ… **Toggle checkbox** to enable/disable paid services
- âœ… **Conditional pricing details** that appear when enabled
- âœ… **Currency symbol display** in price input (â‚®, $, â‚¬)
- âœ… **Real-time pricing preview** showing customer cost

**Form Fields:**
- âœ… **Price input** with currency symbol prefix
- âœ… **Currency selector** (MNT/USD/EUR dropdown)
- âœ… **Pricing type selector** (per service/per hour)
- âœ… **Payment methods checkboxes** with icons
- âœ… **Price description textarea** with character counter
- âœ… **Live pricing preview** with BYL integration status

#### 2. **Smart Pricing Logic**
- âœ… **Context-aware pricing types**: Queue = "per service", Appointments = "per appointment/per hour"
- âœ… **Default values**: Sets â‚®5,000 as default when enabling paid services
- âœ… **Payment method defaults**: BYL selected by default (recommended)
- âœ… **Validation feedback**: Real-time error messages

## ðŸ”„ Customer Payment Flow (Next Steps)

### Phase 1: Display Pricing to Customers
When customers join a paid line, they'll see:

```javascript
// Example line info with pricing
{
  title: "Hair Salon Appointments",
  pricing: {
    isPaid: true,
    price: 15000,
    currency: "MNT",
    priceType: "per_appointment",
    description: "Includes consultation and basic styling"
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Payment Integration
For BYL payments, the flow will be:

1. **Customer joins paid line** â†’ Show price and payment options
2. **Customer selects BYL payment** â†’ Redirect to BYL checkout
3. **Payment successful** â†’ Customer added to queue/appointment booked
4. **Payment failed** â†’ Show error, allow retry

### Phase 3: Alternative Payment Methods
- **Cash payments**: Mark as "pending payment" until confirmed by business
- **Card payments**: Integrate with additional payment processors
- **Bank transfers**: Generate payment reference numbers

## ðŸ’¡ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Coffee Shop Queue (â‚®2,000 per order)
```javascript
{
  serviceType: "queue",
  pricing: {
    isPaid: true,
    price: 2000,
    currency: "MNT",
    priceType: "per_service",
    paymentMethods: ["byl", "cash"],
    description: "Pre-payment for coffee order"
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Hair Salon Appointments ($25 per appointment)
```javascript
{
  serviceType: "appointments",
  pricing: {
    isPaid: true,
    price: 25,
    currency: "USD",
    priceType: "per_appointment",
    paymentMethods: ["byl", "card"],
    description: "Includes consultation and basic styling"
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Consultant Hourly Rate (â‚®50,000 per hour)
```javascript
{
  serviceType: "appointments",
  pricing: {
    isPaid: true,
    price: 50000,
    currency: "MNT",
    priceType: "per_hour",
    paymentMethods: ["byl", "bank_transfer"],
    description: "Professional business consultation"
  }
}
```
